This depository contains differents python tools created during my 2nd year internship at the IRIT (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse) on ultrasound image segmentation with deep learning techniques. It allows to:
- prepare a dataset for instance segmentation using CNN models: image_processing.py
- run and represent predictions with loaded CNN models: forward.py
- execute basic transfer learning on the UNET CNN models: transfer_learning.py
- run segmentation on a UI: segmentation_tool.py 

An open-sourced dataset of breast cancer ultrasound images is also provided. It comes from https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.12538. 

CNN models used to run the segmentation are not available. If you really want them, contact me at tachenne.florent@gmail.com and i will send them to you.
